        <h1>Guess The Number</h1>
        <h3>This website uses JavaScript's Math random function to pick a random number and users are prompted to guess the number. It utilizes a while loop to keep the prompt going until the user guesses the number right and the user will know how many guesses it took them to guess the correct number!</h3>
